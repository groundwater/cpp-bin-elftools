# ELF Tool

My goal is to build an ELF file from hand.
I am allowed to use the `elf.h` headers to determine the size and structure of the file contents,
but everything else should be done by hand.

I may first make tools to dissect an ELF file to help understand what's going on.

## Setup

- The `START` script is all you need
  
  ```
  ./START doctor init setup build
  ```
